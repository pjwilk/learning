Here are some ideas about things that might be good to include on a final:
*Create a fictional student scenario; final exam task is to make three specific suggestions to the student as to how the fictional student can use LHL concepts to be happier and more successful
*Create multiple choice questions to test recollection of content knowledge
*Write and essay comparing the value of essay questions with the value of multiple choice questions based on LHL concepts
